The village had a stubborn ****** that everyone knew. Some kids would tease it by calling it a *****, while others compared it to a *** that barked too much. The poor animal was often described as ****** and ****, yet it carried loads for the farmer every single day. No matter how many times people mocked the ******, the farmer reminded them that even a so-called ***** could be more useful than the loudest *** in town.
