Once upon a time, there was a farmer who owned a stubborn ******. The ****** refused to move when asked, yet it was also clever enough to find food on its own. Every morning, the farmer tried to lead the ****** to the fields, and every evening, the ****** would wander back home slowly, as if it had all the time in the world. Though frustrating, the farmer secretly admired how the ****** always found a way to survive.
