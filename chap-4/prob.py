# list and tuples

things=["apple","banana","mango",7,False] 
# the above things is a list and it can store any kind of data type


# lists can be indexed

l1=[7,8,"madhav",True]
# string are also mutable
# now lets access each index, postive index start from 0 , while negative index start from -1 
# slicing is similar to sttrings , 0:3 means prints from 0th to upto 2 means 3 is not printed , 
# these are some examples to get a better idea
# to print the full list 0:4 index or :4 index can be used , to use a certain element , its index can be called , starting from 0 , to the maxsize-1


# print(l1[0])
# print(l1[-1])
# print(l1[:2])


# print(l1[2])
# print(l1[3])

# print(l1[0:3])
# print(l1[:4])


# l1 = [1,8,7,2,21,15]
# l2=l1.sort()
# l1.append(3)
# print(l1)

# l1.sort()
# print(l1)

# l1.insert(3,17)
# l1.pop(5)
# l1.remove(15)
# print(l1)


# tuple is immutable 

a=(1,2,3,4)
# b=(1,) this tuple contain only 1 element



# a=(32,43,5444,2232,"madhav","html")
# print(a)

# no=a.count(43)
# print(no)



# tup=("apple","banana","grapes","mango","orange","gua",)
